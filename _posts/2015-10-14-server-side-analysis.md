Now that we have our overlay grid working, let's implement some analysis on the server and visualize it using the grid. The analysis we will implement is a basic point density [heatmap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2343681/algorithm-for-heat-map). This type of heatmap represents the relative density of points across space. When used with an analysis grid, it works by having each data point contribute to the 'heat' value of the grid points around it, relative to its distance to those points. The point density heatmap does not look at any data associated with those points, but only the density of those points in space. Thus it can be used to explore patterns in the overall density in a set of geographic data, but does not reveal any patterns in the values of this data. It can also be easily implemented with math operations using a set of data points and our existing grid, and does not require any complex Machine Learning analysis, which we will come to in the next set of tutorials.

The heatmap analysis will be implemented on the server side of our Web Stack, at the same time that the geometry of the grid is generated. Switch to the `03-server-side-analysis` branch in the ['week-5â€™](https://github.com/data-mining-the-city/week-5) repository. Now open the `app.py` file from the main repository directory in a text editor. To implement the heatmap, we will need a few math operations that are not included in the basic distribution of Python. So the first thing we will do is write a few helper functions that will perform specific calculations we will need in our implementation. We will implement these functions at the very top of the `app.py` file, right after the import statements and before any other functions. This will ensure that the functions are loaded and available before any other code is run.

The first function will calculate the distance between two points, which we will need to calculate how much 'heat' a sample point applies to the grid cells around it. Find the line that says:

```python
q = Queue()
```

_After_ this line, write the following function:

```python
def point_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
	return ((x1-x2)**2.0 + (y1-y2)**2.0)**(0.5)
```

This implements the [Pythagorian Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) for finding the distance between two points *(x1, y1)* and *(x2, y2)*. The next function will allow us to remap a number from one range to another. On the following lines, write the function:

```python
def remap(value, min1, max1, min2, max2):
	return float(min2) + (float(value) - float(min1)) * (float(max2) - float(min2)) / (float(max1) - float(min1))
```

This implements [a basic formula](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3451553/value-remapping) for mapping a *value* from the initial range *[min1, max1]* to a target range *[min2, max2]*. The final helper function will take a two dimensional array of values (such as the one representing our analysis grid) and remap the values so that they are in the range *[0, 1]*. This function will ensure that the highest value in the grid is always 1, and the lowest value is always 0, which will allow us to use the same color range for visualization no matter what analysis we're doing. On the following lines, write the function:

```python
def normalizeArray(inputArray):
	maxVal = 0
	minVal = 100000000000

	for j in range(len(inputArray)):
		for i in range(len(inputArray[j])):
			if inputArray[j][i] > maxVal:
				maxVal = inputArray[j][i]
			if inputArray[j][i] < minVal:
				minVal = inputArray[j][i]

	for j in range(len(inputArray)):
		for i in range(len(inputArray[j])):
			inputArray[j][i] = remap(inputArray[j][i], minVal, maxVal, 0, 1)

	return inputArray
```

This function takes an array as an input which is assumed to be a two dimensional grid. It then uses a double loop to check each value in this grid. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the grid, and stores the current row index in the variable j. The inner loop iterates over each item in the list, storing the current column index in the variable i. Within this double loop, we can get the value of each grid cell by using the j and i variables as indexes into the two dimensions of the array. As we scan through the grid values, we keep track of the minimum and maximum values, using a process similar to what you implemented in the homework of a [previous tutorial](http://danilnagy.github.io/dmc/2015/09/16/accessing-orientdb-through-python/). To get the maximum value in the grid, we initially set the value of maxVal very low. Then we compare it to each value in the grid, and if the grid value is higher than the current value of maxVal, we set maxVal to that value. This ensures that by the end of the double loop, maxVal is storing the highest value in the whole grid. We do the same thing to find the minimum value by setting the initial value of minVal very high, and replacing it with any lower value we find in the grid. Once we have the minimum and maximum values within the array, we scan through the grid again with the same set of loops, and use our `remap()` helper function to map the value of each cell from the initial range stored in *[minVal, maxVal]* to our new target range of *[0, 1]*.

Now that we have our helper functions, let's implement the actual heatmap calculation. The heatmap works by ...

We will write the code to calculate the heatmap within the `getData()` function, right after the we calculate the dimensions of the analysis overlay grid, and right before we generate the data for the analysis overlay itself. Find the line that reads:

```python
numW = int(math.floor(w/cell_size))
numH = int(math.floor(h/cell_size))
```

These are the lines that calculate the dimensions of the grid. You should add the following code for caculating the heatmap right _after_ these lines.

The first thing we need to do is establish a two dimensional grid array which matches the size of our analysis overlay and will store the heat values of each grid cell. We will then scan over each feature in the map, and adjust the heat values in the cells according to their distance from the features. Finally, we will use this grid to set the values of the cells in our analysis overlay. 

Our grid will use a nested list structure to represent the two dimensions of the grid. The first level will be a list of rows, and each row will itself be a list of all the values in that row. A simple example of a 3x3 grid containing the numbers 1-9 represented in a nested list would be:

```
[ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]
```

By adding returns and spaces, it looks like this:

```
[ 
	[1,2,3], 
	[4,5,6], 
	[7,8,9] 
]
```

Which shows the two dimensional list in the grid form we're used to seeing. To create this two dimensional list, we will start by creating an empty list and storing it in the variable 'grid':

```python
grid = []
```

We will then create a double loop, similar to what we have seen already, to iterate over each row and column in the grid. On the following lines, write the code:

```python
for j in range(numH):
	grid.append([])
	for i in range(numW):
		grid[j].append(0)
```

The outer loop iterates over the rows in the grid. Within this loop, we append a new empty list to the grid variable which represents each row and stores all the values within this row. The innter loop then iterates through all the columns of the grid. Within this loop, we append a value of 0 to the list of the row we are currently working on (indexed by the j variable). This creates a grid of zeros which will store the heat value of each cell in the grid. For a 3x3 grid the resulting list stored in the 'grid' variable would look like this:

```
[ 
	[0,0,0], 
	[0,0,0], 
	[0,0,0] 
]
```

Now, we will iterate over each feature returned from the database, and add 'heat' to the grid cells based on their distance from the feature. On the following lines, add the loop:

```python
for record in records:

	pos_x = int(remap(record.longitude, lng1, lng2, 0, numW))
	pos_y = int(remap(record.latitude, lat1, lat2, numH, 0))

	spread = 15

	for j in range(max(0, (pos_y-spread)), min(numH, (pos_y+spread))):
		for i in range(max(0, (pos_x-spread)), min(numW, (pos_x+spread))):
			grid[j][i] += 2 * math.exp((-point_distance(i,j,pos_x,pos_y)**2)/(2*5**2))
```

The first line iterates through all the records stored in the 'records' list, and stores each one in a variable called 'record' so we can reference it within the loop. The next two lines use the `remap()` helper function we defined earlier to figure out the x and y position of the feature point within the analysis grid. We do this by remapping the latitude and longitude of the feature from the initial range represented by the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude of the browser window (stored in the lat1/lat2, lng1/lng2 variables) to the target range represented by the dimensions of the grid (stored in numW and numH). Since latitude increases from top to bottom while the numbering of the grid rows starts from the top, we have to flip the target range. Now the lower latitude values (closer to the bottom of the screen) will be mapped properly to higher row number (which increase toward the bottom of the screen). If you don't do this the analysis will be flipped vertically on the screen.

Now that we have the location of the feature in the grid, we can iterate through the grid and add heat to the cells based on their distance from the feature. To control the effect that distance has on the heat added to the cells of the analysis grid, we create a new variable called 'spread'. This variable can be given a different value for each record, and could be used to control the relative effect that each record has on the heatmap. In our case, we will set this value as a constant 15 for each record, which specifies that each record will affect the grid cells within a radius of 15 grid cells around it. 

Next we create a double loop to iterate over all the grid cells around the record and add heat to the cells by incrementing the value stored in the corresponding place in the 'grid' list. To speed up the calculation we limit the loops to only look at cells within the range specified in the 'spread' variable. In the outer loop, we will be looking at all the rows starting from 15 less than the position of the record, to 15 more. For example, if the current record is located within the 23rd row, we will only look from row 8 (23-15) to row 38 (23+15). To make sure we don't reference any rows that don't exist in the grid, we use the `max()` and `min()` function to limit the range so that it is not lower than 0 and is not larger than the number of rows in the grid. We put the minimmum and maximum row indexes in the `range()` function, which gives us a list of indexes starting from the minimum and ending at the maximum. In the inner loop, we use the same logic to iterate over the columns of the grid within the range set by the 'spread' variable.

Within this double loop, we perform the actual calculation that increments the 'heat' stored in each grid cell with a value based on that cell's proximity to the record. We will base this calculation on the [Gaussian function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function), which creates a smooth transition from the highest values which occur at smaller distances to lower values which occur as the distance increases. 

![gaussian](/dmc/images/gaussian01.png)

![gaussian](/dmc/images/gaussian02.png)

_Description of Gaussian function from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function)._

In the Gaussian function, the 'a' constant controls the height of the curve, which we arbitrarily set as 2 (since we will eventually normalize all the values we only care about relative values, not the total amount). The 'b' constant controls the center of the peak of the curve, which we keep at 0 to make sure that the heat is centered around the feature point. The 'c' constant controls the width of the curve, which we set to be a multiple of the 'spread' variable. This will allows to control the diffusion of heat in the heatmap by changing this 'spread' variable. As the 'x' variable in the function, we pass the distance between each grid cell (represented by i and j) and the record feature (represented by pos_x and pos_y), which is calculated by the `point_distance` helper function we wrote earlier. We then increment the  value of the current grid cell (represented by `grid[j][i]`) by the value coming out of the function using the '+=' operator. For the purpose of this class, you do not have to understand how the Gaussian function works, but you should understand how you can tweak its parameters to create different distributions of heat in the heatmap based on the density of the features in the dataset.

![grid](/dmc/images/grid06.png)

Once we iterate over all the records and add heat to the affected grid cells, we will use the `normalizeArray()` helper function we wrote previously to normalize the whole 'grid' list to make sure that the lowest value in the analysis grid will be 0 and the highest value will be 1. On the following line, type:

```python
grid = normalizeArray(grid)
```

Now that we have a grid with 'heat' values corresponding to the density of the feature points, we can use these values to set the value of the analysis grid cells being sent back to the client. A few lines down in the code, find the line that reads:

```python
newItem['value'] = .5
```

This line is currently setting the value of each analysis grid cells to a default '.5'. Let's change this to get the value of the corresponding cell in the 'grid' list. Change this line to read:

```python
newItem['value'] = grid[j][i]
```

Now the value in the analysis grid will match the heat values we generated earlier, with higher heat values representing a higher density of feature points. Notice that since we normalized the list of heat values to be in the range from [0, 1], our color range on the client side will still work, with a value of 0 creating the least saturation, and a value of 1 creating the most saturated red.

Save the `app.py` file and start the server by running the `app.py` file in the Command Prompt or Terminal, or within a Canopy session. Make sure you also have your OrientDB server running, and have changed the database name and login information in the `app.py` file to match your database. Go to  [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) in your browser. You should now see the same analysis grid, but this time the grid should be more red in areas with larger concentrations of record features, and less red in aread of lower concentrations. Go back to the `app.py` file and experiment with different settings for the 'spread' variable, to see how this effects the distribution of heat in the overlay. 

![overlay](/dmc/images/overlay01.png)

The heatmap is working, but it is a bit hard to see the variation in the red color. To create a more legible visualization, let's go back to the client side code, and change the way that color is assigned to the grid rectangles. Open the `script.js` file within the `/static` folder in a text editor, and find the line that reads:

```javascript
.attr("fill", function(d) { return "hsl(0, " + Math.floor(d.value*100) + "%, 50%)"; });
```

This line is using the `hsl()` function to allow the 'value' parameter of each grid cell to control the saturation of the red color. Let's change this line to read:

```javascript
.attr("fill", function(d) { return "hsl(" + Math.floor((1-d.value)*250) + ", 100%, 50%)"; });
```

This code again uses the `hsl()` function, but now uses the 'value' parameter to control the hue of the color while setting the saturation to a constant 100%. Since the 'value' data is normalized to the range [0, 1], we can multiply this value by 250 to create a range of colors from the hue 0 (which represents red) to a hue 250 (which represents blue). To associate the higher values with red and the lower values with blue (which is more intuitive), we subtract the value from 1 (which effective flips the range). Save the file and reload [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/) to see the new visualization.

To finish up our implementation of the analysis overlay, let's add functionality to the 'heatmap' checkbox we created earlier to allow it to control whether the analysis is executed after the data query, and whether it is visualized in the client's browser. To do this we will add one more argument to the query string that is sent with the request to the server. This argument will be a boolean value which specifies whether the 'heatmap' checkbox is checked. The server will then use that boolean to control whether the analysis is performed after the data query. We will also use this boolean in the client code to control whether the rectangle geometry is created for the grid. Open the `script.js` file again and find the line that reads:

```javascript
request = "/getData?lat1=" + lat1 + "&lat2=" + lat2 + "&lng1=" + lng1 + "&lng2=" + lng2 + "&w=" + w + "&h=" + h + "&cell_size=" + cell_size
```

This is the current request we are sending to the server. Let's add another line _before_ the request to check whether the checkbox is checked, and store this value in a new variable:

```javascript
var checked = document.getElementById("heatmap").checked
```

Here we are using the 'document' object, which stores a reference to our entire HTML page. We are then using the document's `.getElementById()` method to locate the checkbox (remember that when we created it in the HTML code we assigned it an id of "heatmap"). Finally, we access the checkbox's `.checked` property to see if the checkbox is currently checked. Then, we are storing this value in a new variable called 'checked'.

Now that we have this information, let's append it to the query string of the request being set to the server. Find the request line again, and chenge it to read:

```javascript
request = "/getData?lat1=" + lat1 + "&lat2=" + lat2 + "&lng1=" + lng1 + "&lng2=" + lng2 + "&w=" + w + "&h=" + h + "&cell_size=" + cell_size + "&analysis=" + checked
```

You can see that we added the 'checked' boolean as a new argument in the query string attached to the key 'analysis'. Still in the `script.js` file, let's use this boolean value to control whether the rectangle geometry is generated after the data comes back from the server. Find the block of code that starts with:

```javascript
var topleft = projectPoint(lat2, lng1);
```

and ends with:

```javascript
.attr("fill", function(d) { return "hsl(" + Math.floor((1-d.value)*250) + ", 100%, 50%)"; });
```

This is the code that generates the rectangle geometry for the analysis overlay. To make sure that this code runs only when the heatmap is active, wrap the _entire block of code_ in a coditional that checks the value of the 'checked' boolean. The whole block of code should now look like this:

```javascript
if (checked == true){
	var topleft = projectPoint(lat2, lng1);

	svg_overlay.attr("width", w)
		.attr("height", h)
		.style("left", topleft.x + "px")
		.style("top", topleft.y + "px");

	var rectangles = g_overlay.selectAll("rect").data(data.analysis);
	rectangles.enter().append("rect");

	rectangles
		.attr("x", function(d) { return d.x; })
		.attr("y", function(d) { return d.y; })
		.attr("width", function(d) { return d.width; })
		.attr("height", function(d) { return d.height; })
    	.attr("fill-opacity", ".2")
    	.attr("fill", function(d) { return "hsl(" + Math.floor((1-d.value)*250) + ", 100%, 50%)"; });
};
```

Now the rectangles will only be created if the 'heatmap' checkbox is checked and the value of the 'checked' boolean is 'true'. If you don't implement this conditional, JavaScript will generate an error when it tries to create the rectangle geometry based on grid data that is not being returned from the server.

Now let's implement functionality on the server so that the heatmap analysis is only performed when the 'heatmap' checkbox is checked. Open the `app.py` file from the main repository directory in a text editor and find the line that reads:

```python
cell_size = float(request.args.get('cell_size'))
```

This is the last in a series of lines which extract the arguments sent through the query string of the request to the server. _Directly below this line_ add a new line to extract the value of the checkbox that is passed in the 'analysis' argument:

```python
analysis = request.args.get('analysis')
```

Since in this case we are sending a string, we do not have to wrap it in the `float()` function. Now the variable 'analysis' is storing the value of the checkbox on the client side, 'true' if the checkbox is checked, and 'false' if it is not. To have this value control the execution of the analysis code, we will create a conditional before the analysis starts which will check the value of the 'analysis' boolean and return the dataset directly to the server if the variable is 'false'. This will cause the function to terminate, effectively skipping the remainder of the function which contains the heatmap analysis. In the `app.py` file, find the line that reads:

```python
q.put('starting analysis...')
```

This message marks the beginning of the heatmap analysis code. _Directly before this line_, add the following lines of code:

```python
if analysis == "false":
	q.put('idle')
	return json.dumps(output)
```

This conditional checks the value of the 'analysis' boolean. If its value is 'false', meaning that the 'heatmap' checkbox is unchecked, the code places the 'idle' message in the queue, signifying that the server process is complete, and returns the data stored in the 'output' dictionary back to the client. Thus the heatmap analysis is skipped, and no analysis data is sent back to the client. If you save the file and reload [`http://localhost:5000/`](http://localhost:5000/), you will see that the analysis overlay is not initially visualized, since the checkbox is unchecked by default. However, if you check the 'heatmap' checkbox and click the 'Update Data' button, you will see that the analysis is performed on the server, and the heatmap is visualized in the browser.
