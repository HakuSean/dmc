Now that we understand variables, we can start to develop more complex code structures which can build more interesting functionality into our scripts. Up to this point, our scripts have been pretty basic, and limit to only executing in a top-down order, with one command or operation per line. The following two concepts, **conditionals** and **loops**, are the two basic 'flow control' structures which can actually alter the sequence in which our code is executed, thereby creating more complex behavior and more interesting functionality. 

## 4. Functions

We have already seen some function such as type(), str(), .append(), .keys(), and range().

## 5. Objects
