In order to complete the assignments for this class, you will use [Github](https://github.com/), a [distributed revision control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) tool that is extremely popular with software developers. Github is used by developers to manage code on other files related to projects, and to organize it in a way that makes it easy to develop projects within a team. With text and other [human-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_medium) files Github can keep track of changes being made, allowing you to easily see which parts of the project are being developed, and to roll back changes if necessary. Github also provides several other features useful for software development, including different access control to different parts of the project, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. You can think of Github as Google Docs, in that it keeps track of changes in text documents and allows collaboration on documents between different team members. Unlike Google Docs, however, Github is much more structured, and uses explicit changes or 'commits' to keep track of the changes being made by each person on the team.

Github will allow us to keep track of our code as we develop the DMC Web Stack, and to streamline the process of turning in assignments. In the process, we will learn some of the standards of how code is developed in the real world. If you've never used it before, Github can seem a bit daunting and even counter-intuitive. Luckily, Github provides many [resources](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) for learning the system by following step-by-step [tutorials](https://guides.github.com/). I recommend you at least go through the ['Hello World'](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial before proceeding with the rest of this lab.

Note: Github is based on the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system, which is used completely throught the command line (by typing text commands rather than clicking buttons on a graphic user interface). However, Github also provides a standalone [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/) with a graphic user interface which can be easier to use for beginners. The client supports all the features you need to accomplish these labs, so you should not have to use the command line interface, but feel free to learn, explore, and use it if you are comfortable with it.

###Forking and Branching, Push and Pulling

To structure collaboration and keep track of document revisions, Github is based on a very specific [workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Each project is contained within its own **repository**, which you can think of as a folder on your desktop. This repository exists on Github's servers, but you can also **clone** the repository to your desktop, where it will live inside a specified folder (usually called Git or Github within your My Documents folder). The Github software will then take care of syncing your local folder to the contents of the repository.

Each repository can contain multiple **branches** or versions of the project. When you start a project, by default all of your changes will go on the *master* branch, which is the main version of your project. At any point you can start another branch, which will replicate all your files and allow you to make changes without affecting the master branch. In software development this is used to test out ideas or features in a safe way, while master maintains the latest stable working version of the code. At any point you can merge the contents of a branch with the master, and the Github interface will help you to look through the changes and handle any conflicts.

When you make a change to a document locally, Github will not automatically save the changes to the repository. To update the project with your changes, you need to push a **commit** to the repository. The commit tracks every change made to every document since the last commit, and provides a clear revision history of the project. At any point, you can step through the commits to undo any changes that have been made.

In addition to storing and tracking your own projects, Github provides several options for contributing to other people's projects. By default, all code on Github is open-source, meaning everyone can see the code freely. However, you cannot make changes or 'commit' to it without being granted permission by the repository's owners. Another way to contribute to a project is to **fork** the project, or create your own version of the repository under your own account. This fork will function just like the main repository, allowing you to make changes and push commits to it, but will exist separately. You are free to keep developing this fork on your own, and even spin it off as its own separate project. If at any point you want to contribute your changes to the main project, you can submit a **pull request**, which will alert the repository owners of any changes you have made, and give them the chance to either accept the pull request and merge in the code, or deny it and keep their code as it is. This fork/pull request workflow is quite common in [open-source software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development), where many people might be contributing to a project without a higher level organization structure.
