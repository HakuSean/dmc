Welcome to Data Mining the City. The purpose of this class is to explore how new technologies such as Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning could be applied to urban analysis to allow us to understand our cities better. The goal of this series of tutorials is to guide you through the creation of a minimal proof of concept that will show some of the possibilies of these new technologies, and provide a basic framework that you can expand for your own research.
