Welcome to Data Mining the City! The purpose of this class is to explore how new technologies such as Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning could be applied to urban analysis to allow us to understand our cities better. The goal of this series of tutorials is to guide you through the creation of a minimal proof of concept that will show some of the possibilies of these new technologies, and provide a basic framework that you can expand for your own research.

From a technological standpoint, one of the goals of the class is to propose the next evolution of software for urban analysis. Currently most urban analysis is done within a handful of software packages known as Geographic Information Systems or GIS. These are, for the most part, fairly traditional software packages, released closed source by large corporations, and costing up to several thousands of dollars to use. One notable accesption is a collection of new open-sourced tools such as QGIS, which can be used for free, and extended from the source code. However, ability to extend the code base requires knowledge in computer porgramming, and is out of reach for most urban analysis professionals.

While GIS software has changed relatively little in the last two decades, the growth of the internet has slowly revolutionized the way that most software is developed, acquired, and used. While the internet began as a series of static web pages that could be accessed from within a user's browser, over time new technologies were developed that could offload some of the more computationaly expensive aspects of a website such as data storage and processing onto a 'backend' server  existing remotely. Meanwhile, the user's 'frontend' could be kept light, reducing the need for powerful computers on the user end. This separation between 'frontend' visualization and 'backend' data storage and processing was referred to as 'Web 2.0', and made possible a host of new internet such as social networks and online retail that we rely on today.

In recent years, however, this concept of a distributed web framework has been extended into applications previously handled by traditional software. For example, Google Docs can accomplish many of the same tasks as a traditional word processor such as Microsoft Word, but
