Welcome to Data Mining the City! The purpose of this class is to explore how new technologies such as Big Data, Data Mining, and Machine Learning could be applied to urban analysis to allow us to understand our cities better. The goal of this series of tutorials is to guide you through the creation of a minimal proof of concept that will show some of the possibilies of these new technologies, and provide a basic framework that you can expand for your own research.

From a technological standpoint, one of the goals of the class is to propose the next evolution of software for urban analysis. Currently most urban analysis is done within a handful of software packages known as Geographic Information Systems or GIS. These are, for the most part, fairly traditional software packages, released closed source by large corporations, and costing up to several thousands of dollars to use. One notable accesption is a collection of new open-sourced tools such as QGIS, which can be used for free, and extended from the source code. However, ability to extend the code base requires knowledge in computer porgramming, and is out of reach for most urban analysis professionals.

While GIS software has changed relatively little in the last two decades, the growth of the internet has created revolutionized the way that most software is developed, acquired, and used. To understand the nature of this revolution, we can take a quick look at the history of the web

History of the Web

- Web 1.0 (1990-2000) - 
- Web 2.0 (2000-2010) - 
- Web 3.0 (2010-) - 


This revolution has been brought on by the growth of the internet, and various new technologies and platforms that have been created to make the internet what it is today.
