While HTML is the core language behind webpages, HTML by itself only deals with layout, and at most can only represent static pages containing graphics and text. This is what the web was like before the late 1990's, when you would go to a website mostly to find out information about companies, which would be designed as a static document in HTML. Nowadays the websites we use most are much more dynamic, with content being generated on the fly according to constantly updating data and user interactions. The secret behind these dynamics is JavaScript, which is a scripting language that runs on the web, and can be used to easily add dynamic content to web pages. JavaScript is now ubiquitous on the web, and a basic understanding of it is crucial if you want to do any work even remotely related to web development. 

Just like Python, JavaScript has many libraries and extensions that are designed to simplify specific tasks. In this tutorial, we will introduce the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library, which is an extremely popular library designed for interactive and dynamic web visualization. In the next tutorial we will use the [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) library, which automates the creation of interactive web maps.

Unlike Python, however, there is nothing to install. Infact, all web browsers already include JavaScript support, making it really easy to get started. Libraries also don't need to be installed. Instead, you put their files (which you can download from their websites and usually come as one or more .js files) in a folder on your server, and then include them in any website that uses their code. If you forked the ['week-3'](https://github.com/data-mining-the-city/week-3) repository you should already have a '/lib' (for 'libraries') folder set up within a '/static' folder in your file structure. 

* As with most of the technologies we will use in these tutorials, a thorough description and training in JavaScript and D3 is beyond the scope of this class. However, since JavaScript is **THE** language of the web, the internet is full of super useful tutorials and resources that you can use to find solutions or simply learn more about it. At the end of this tutorial I will include a list of my favorite resources, but you should feel confortable at this point searching online for resources for anything you're wondering about or anything that is not covered explicitly in these tutorials

To start using JavaScript and the D3.js library, open up the 'index.html' file.

A class in itself, this is a great resource for learning D3 if you have the time to go through it. Covers all the basic from the beginning, including a very thorough explanation of data binding, which can be tricky when you're first getting started.
