### Installation:

Python is not a piece of software as you would usually think of it, but a programming language. Therefore, you do not install and run in the same way as you would usually with a program. However, there are pieces of softwares called 'distributions' that come with code editors and package managers that make working with Python easier, especially beginners. Among other things, such distributions also solve many annoying issues with different platforms. In DMC we will use the [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) ditribution.

Start by [creating an account](https://store.enthought.com/accounts/login/) and applying for an academic licence. This will give you access to the full distribution. After you've created your account you should be able to download the full distribution.
